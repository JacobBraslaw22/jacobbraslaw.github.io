# Hi, I'm Jacob Braslaw.
</center>

  I am a senior Environmental Science major at UC Santa Barbara. My interests are in large scale environmental action and medicine. In regards to environmental science my areas of study are primarily in renewable energy and GIS. I have worked with renewable energy designs and implementations through UCSB's Clean Energy Transformation Lab (CET Lab) run by Professor Deshmukh. 
  
Currently I work as teaching assistant for Environmental Studies 115, Energy and the Environment. The course focuses on introduction to the mechanical power generating systems and varying efficiencies of types of systems.

During the summer of 2020 I completed two courses that use R and R studio. I have become proficient in using R for both statistical and geographical analysis. Geographical analysis skills I learned include data manipulation, analysis with raster and vector data, writing functions, and creating maps.

If you are interested in working with, or want to contact me, you can reach out at [jacobbraslaw@ucsb.edu](jacobbraslaw@ucsb.edu)

  When I am not in the library working, I am often seen on the baseball field as a member of UCSB Club Baseball or found out at Sands Beach surfing through sunset with my friends!

### *Where I'm From*

I grew up in Pacifica, CA, a small coastal town 20 miles south of San Francisco. I went to [Terra Nova High 
School](https://www.juhsd.net/tnhs) then attended [College of San Mateo](https://smccd.edu/) where I completed my general education with a biology focus and participated in intercollegiate baseball. In 2018 I transferred to [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) and plan to graduate in December 2020.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(rmapshaper)

places <- USAboundaries::us_cities() %>% 
  filter(city %in% c("Pacifica", "Santa Barbara", "San Mateo")) %>% 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  st_transform(4326)

city<- c("Santa Barbara", "Pacifica","San Mateo")
feature<- c( "UC Santa Barbara","Hometown", "College of San Mateo")

travels<- data.frame(city,feature)
places<-full_join(places,travels, by = "city")



leaflet(width= "100%") %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri)%>% addMarkers(data = places, label = ~city, popup = ~feature)
```
